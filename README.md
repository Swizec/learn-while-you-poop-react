# Learn While You Poop â€“Â React

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m trying something new and need your feedback. What do you think of this as a format for a daily 2min video?

No pressure learning at 2 minutes per day. Start with WHY React all the way to a React 16.3 master in a month.

Follow along [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/SwizecTeller) or [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/981932124231024640) to watch the videos every day at about 9:30am Pacific.
